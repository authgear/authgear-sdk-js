The reason to have this file listed in package.json is to work around an issue of React Native codegen.
This library includes generated code, so codegen is not required to run at all.
However, codegen eagerly looks at `.codegenConfig.jsSrcsDir` and requires it to present in the distributed package.
So, we have to work around the issue by including the directory.
