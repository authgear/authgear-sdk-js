With Authgear SDK for Single Page Applications (SPA), you can easily integrate authentication features into your app (Angular, Vue, React, or any JavaScript websites).
In most cases, it involves just **a few lines of code** to enable **multiple authentication methods**, such as [social logins](https://www.authgear.com/features/social-login), [passwordless](https://www.authgear.com/features/passwordless-authentication), [biometrics logins](https://www.authgear.com/features/biometric-authentication), [one-time-password (OTP)](https://www.authgear.com/features/whatsapp-otp) with SMS/WhatsApp, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## What is Authgear?

[Authgear](https://www.authgear.com/) is a highly adaptable identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) platform for web and mobile applications.
Authgear makes user authentication easier and faster to implement by integrating it into various types of applications - from single-page web apps to mobile applications to API services.

### Key Features

- Zero trust authentication architecture with [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) (OIDC) standard.
- Easy-to-use interfaces for user registration and login, including email, phone, username as login ID, and password, OTP, magic links, etc for authentication.
- Support a wide range of identity providers, such as [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity), [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/deployment/depa64848f3a/web), and [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/active-directory/) (AD).
- Support biometric login on mobile, Passkeys, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) such as SMS/email-based verification and authenticator apps with TOTP.
